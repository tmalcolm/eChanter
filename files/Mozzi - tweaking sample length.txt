Hi Philippe,
you might be able to do it better with a tool like sox, but anyway, with
Audacity, how about this:

Set the project rate so that the duration of your wave will make it fit into
8192 samples of audio played back at that rate. eg.

original_duration = 0.6 seconds
original_number_of_samples = 10000
original_sample_rate = 10000 * 1/0.6 = 16666.66 Hz

To get the sound to be 8192 samples long,
set the project rate to 
   original_sample_rate * 8192/original_number_of_samples = 13653 Hz

To check, 0.6 seconds * 13653 Hz = 8191.8

Then export your sample to raw 8 bit and it should be OK to convert with
char2mozzi.py

You might have to manually adjust the file produced by char2mozzi.py, if it
makes it a sample too short..

Does that make sense?  Will it work?
